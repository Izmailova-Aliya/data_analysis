# Municipal Waste generated by countries
Analysis of municipal waste rate by countries. In this project, I analyze the municipal waste of tonnes generated by countries, what percentage of this waste countries recycle. All municipal waste is divided into six different categories (food/organic, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and other). All of this information taken from the World BanK official web-site (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/what-waste-global-database/resource/de74cc68-e796-4e42-9793-f140719c91ac#{}).

Also, there data anout GDP of a country, and for some of them I use web-scrapping to fill missing data.

Because of using plotly.express library some of the graph are hidden (to see them try to download).
